The lack of an abstract and a keyword in the publication makes this situation 
difficult to provide accurate search results and it prevents the researcher to review the publication 
quickly. 
This study proposes a method to generate keywords and an abstract from the text that can be used in 
academic studies. 
In the previous studies, k-NN and fuzzy CCG methods have been generally used to solve this problem.
Nonetheless, the structures of words have not been examined and semantic analysis has not been 
used for solving this problem. 
In this study, the sections of the publication are also divided into parts such as the references, the 
introduction and the methodology.
Each section is graded differently so that the word in each section has a different score. Furthermore, 
NLP methods were used to analyze 
texts and phrases, removing prepositions and conjunctions.
